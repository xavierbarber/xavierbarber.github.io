I\n            earned my PhD in Statistics in 2009. As a statistician, I\n            find immense fulfillment in applying statistical\n            methodologies to real-world challenges. My routine work\n            involves leveraging Bayesian statistics, and I am committed\n            to employing spatio-temporal hierarchical techniques in\n            ecological research, particularly in Species Distribution\n            Modeling. Currently, my primary theoretical and practical\n            focus is on quantifying uncertainty in this area of\n            research. Additionally, in my role as the head of the joint\n            research unit UMH-FISABIO, I concentrate on advanced\n            statistical methods in the health sciences field.\n            Allow me to briefly outline the most noteworthy\n            accomplishments from my recent academic pursuits:\n            I have authored over 100 publications, including\n            articles in JCR journals, SCOPUS, dialnet, book chapters,\n            and conference proceedings. Notably, I have developed or\n            contributed to 59 articles in JCR journals. My research\n            journey commenced with a ‘Formación de Personal Investigador\n            (FPI)’ grant (1997-2005), initially tied to Public Health,\n            resulting in my early publications in journals such as BMC\n            Cancer, Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health,\n            European Journal of Epidemiology, among others.\n            Subsequently, my academic path led me to the Polytechnic\n            School of Orihuela, where my research found its footing in\n            Agronomy and Food Technology—an area in which I remain\n            active today, spanning topics such as Food Quality, Food\n            Chemistry, Crops and Industrial Products, Soil Science, and\n            Plant Analysis.\n            From 2020 to 2022, I was a part of ‘Valencia IA 4\n            Covid,’ a taskforce working group led by Dr. Nuria Oliver,\n            which provided counsel to the Regional Government utilizing\n            Artificial Intelligence to combat Covid-19. Our group\n            emerged as the victor of the worldwide Xprize ‘Pandemic\n            Response Challenge,’ and I have contributed multiple\n            publications on this subject.\n            Within the realm of Bayesian Spatial Statistics, my\n            work has been featured in journals such as Mathematics,\n            JABES, SORT, and GeoSpatial Health. I have also presented\n            over 30 papers at conferences (out of a total of 235),\n            including several invited talks.\n            I have participated in more than 20 projects\n            (continuous funding since 2006) and research contracts,\n            often in the role of principal investigator. I am a member\n            of the National Network BIOSTATNET, and the excellence AIDS\n            Research Network, CIBER-Infecciosas.\n            Regarding knowledge transfer, I played a role in the\n            establishment of the spin-off company Compostingreen S.L.\n            and contributed to the development of significant\n            statistical software, including one created for Eurostat,\n            used for predicting agricultural production in the EU.\n            Additionally, I have worked on the ‘eat:efficiency analysis\n            trees’ R-package, a valuable tool.\n            I earned the Best Poster Award at the International\n            Workshop on Statistical Modelling 2010, where I presented a\n            poster on my thesis titled ‘Geostatistical models for the\n            study of bioclimatic indices.’ I have also received 3 UMH\n            awards for Research Production.\n            My teaching experience extends from 2004,\n            encompassing both undergraduate and postgraduate levels.\n            Since 2018, I have held the position of Associate Professor.\n            I have been invited to teach in more than 20 postgraduate\n            courses and subjects, as well as engage in various teaching\n            activities across different institutions. In 2016 and 2022,\n            I received the Teaching Talent Award, and in 2020.\n            I have supervised 1 Ph.D. Thesis and I’m now\n            supervising 3 more. also, I supervised 67 Master’s Theses\n            (58 Master’s Degrees in Secondary Education and 9 research\n            master’s degrees), 11 Final Theses, 1 Final Thesis Erasmus+,\n            and 5 Final Degree Projects. Additionally, I have provided\n            guidance to over 20 internship students.\n            My commitment to continual improvement in teaching is\n            evident through the publication of 11 teaching papers,\n            involvement in 8 innovation projects (5 as the principal\n            investigator), and the acquisition of the title of\n            university expert in Technological Innovation in Education.\n            I have also participated in more than 20 training courses\n            and conferences. Consequently, I have transitioned from\n            being a learner to being an educator, delivering training\n            courses within the UMH-plan for teaching\n            innovation.\n            In the realm of university management, I served as\n            Deputy Vice Rector for Research from 2011 to the present\n            (2011-2015, 2015-2019, 2019-2023). Since 2015, I have held\n            the position of President of the Animal Welfare Comission at\n            UMH. I also serve as Secretary of the UMH Research\n            Commission and as a Member of the Doctoral\n            Commission.\n            From 2014 to 2019, I held the role of\n            Treasurer for the Spanish Society of Biostatistics\n            (Spanish region of the International Biometric\n            Society).\n            I lead the Joint Research Unit for statistical\n            methods in health sciences UMH-FISABIO, I am also a member\n            of the ‘Valencia Bayesian Research Group’.\n            \n            \n            Last publications\n            Fernández-Gómez, L., Sánchez-Zapata, J.

        CV Summary\n              I am Dr. Xavier Barber, born in 1972 in Dénia, Spain. I\n              earned my PhD in Statistics in 2009. As a statistician, I\n              find immense fulfillment in applying statistical\n              methodologies to real-world challenges. My routine work\n              involves leveraging Bayesian statistics, and I am\n              committed to employing spatio-temporal hierarchical\n              techniques in ecological research, particularly in Species\n              Distribution Modeling. Currently, my primary theoretical\n              and practical focus is on quantifying uncertainty in this\n              area of research. Additionally, in my role as the head of\n              the joint research unit UMH-FISABIO, I concentrate on\n              advanced statistical methods in the health sciences\n              field.\n              Allow me to briefly outline the most noteworthy\n              accomplishments from my recent academic pursuits:\n              I have authored over 100 publications, including\n              articles in JCR journals, SCOPUS, dialnet, book chapters,\n              and conference proceedings. Notably, I have developed or\n              contributed to 59 articles in JCR journals. My research\n              journey commenced with a ‘Formación de Personal\n              Investigador (FPI)’ grant (1997-2005), initially tied to\n              Public Health, resulting in my early publications in\n              journals such as BMC Cancer, Journal of Epidemiology and\n              Community Health, European Journal of Epidemiology, among\n              others. Subsequently, my academic path led me to the\n              Polytechnic School of Orihuela, where my research found\n              its footing in Agronomy and Food Technology—an area in\n              which I remain active today, spanning topics such as Food\n              Quality, Food Chemistry, Crops and Industrial Products,\n              Soil Science, and Plant Analysis.\n              From 2020 to 2022, I was a part of ‘Valencia IA 4\n              Covid,’ a taskforce working group led by Dr. Nuria Oliver,\n              which provided counsel to the Regional Government\n              utilizing Artificial Intelligence to combat Covid-19. Our\n              group emerged as the victor of the worldwide Xprize\n              ‘Pandemic Response Challenge,’ and I have contributed\n              multiple publications on this subject.\n              Within the realm of Bayesian Spatial Statistics, my\n              work has been featured in journals such as Mathematics,\n              JABES, SORT, and GeoSpatial Health. I have also presented\n              over 30 papers at conferences (out of a total of 235),\n              including several invited talks.\n              I have participated in more than 20 projects\n              (continuous funding since 2006) and research contracts,\n              often in the role of principal investigator. I am a member\n              of the National Network BIOSTATNET, and the excellence\n              AIDS Research Network, CIBER-Infecciosas.\n              Regarding knowledge transfer, I played a role in\n              the establishment of the spin-off company Compostingreen\n              S.L. and contributed to the development of significant\n              statistical software, including one created for Eurostat,\n              used for predicting agricultural production in the EU.\n              Additionally, I have worked on the ‘eat:efficiency\n              analysis trees’ R-package, a valuable tool.\n              I earned the Best Poster Award at the International\n              Workshop on Statistical Modelling 2010, where I presented\n              a poster on my thesis titled ‘Geostatistical models for\n              the study of bioclimatic indices.’ I have also received 3\n              UMH awards for Research Production.\n              My teaching experience extends from 2004,\n              encompassing both undergraduate and postgraduate levels.\n              Since 2018, I have held the position of Associate\n              Professor. I have been invited to teach in more than 20\n              postgraduate courses and subjects, as well as engage in\n              various teaching activities across different institutions.\n              In 2016 and 2022, I received the Teaching Talent Award,\n              and in 2020.\n              I have supervised 1 Ph.D. Thesis and I’m now\n              supervising 3 more. also, I supervised 67 Master’s Theses\n              (58 Master’s Degrees in Secondary Education and 9 research\n              master’s degrees), 11 Final Theses, 1 Final Thesis\n              Erasmus+, and 5 Final Degree Projects. Additionally, I\n              have provided guidance to over 20 internship\n              students.\n              My commitment to continual improvement in teaching\n              is evident through the publication of 11 teaching papers,\n              involvement in 8 innovation projects (5 as the principal\n              investigator), and the acquisition of the title of\n              university expert in Technological Innovation in\n              Education. I have also participated in more than 20\n              training courses and conferences. Consequently, I have\n              transitioned from being a learner to being an educator,\n              delivering training courses within the UMH-plan for\n              teaching innovation.\n              In the realm of university management, I served as\n              Deputy Vice Rector for Research from 2011 to the present\n              (2011-2015, 2015-2019, 2019-2023). Since 2015, I have held\n              the position of President of the Animal Welfare Comission\n              at UMH. I also serve as Secretary of the UMH Research\n              Commission and as a Member of the Doctoral\n              Commission.\n              From 2014 to 2019, I held the role of\n              Treasurer for the Spanish Society of Biostatistics\n              (Spanish region of the International Biometric\n              Society).\n              I lead the Joint Research Unit for statistical\n              methods in health sciences UMH-FISABIO, I am also a member\n              of the ‘Valencia Bayesian Research Group’.\n              \n              \n              Last publications\n              Fernández-Gómez, L., Sánchez-Zapata, J.
