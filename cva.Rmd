## CV Summary
  
I am Dr. Xavier Barber, born in Dénia, Spain, in 1972. I earned my PhD in statistics in 2009, and as a statistician, I derive great satisfaction from applying statistical methodologies to real-world scenarios. I routinely utilize Bayesian statistics and endeavor to apply spatio-temporal hierarchical techniques to ecological research, particularly within the realm of Species Distribution Modeling. Presently, my primary theoretical and applied interest revolves around quantifying uncertainty in this research domain. Additionally, in my role as the head of the joint research unit UMH-FISABIO, I focus on advanced statistical methods applied to the field of health sciences.

Allow me to briefly outline the most noteworthy accomplishments from my recent academic pursuits:

- I have authored over 100 publications, including articles in JCR journals, SCOPUS, dialnet, book chapters, and conference proceedings. Notably, I have developed or contributed to 49 articles in JCR journals. My research journey commenced with a 'Formación de Personal Investigador (FPI)' grant (1997-2005), initially tied to Public Health, resulting in my early publications in journals such as BMC Cancer, Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, European Journal of Epidemiology, among others. Subsequently, my academic path led me to the Polytechnic School of Orihuela, where my research found its footing in Agronomy and Food Technology—an area in which I remain active today, spanning topics such as Food Quality, Food Chemistry, Crops and Industrial Products, Soil Science, and Plant Analysis. I have received two CNEAI periods (2008-2013, 2014-2019) and one AVAP (2005-2010). Regrettably, I am ineligible to apply for periods preceding 2005 due to my tenure in private companies, which is incompatible with such applications. Nevertheless, I have publications with a substantial number of citations from the period 1997-2004.

- From 2020 to 2022, I was a part of 'Valencia IA 4 Covid,' a taskforce working group led by Dr. Nuria Oliver, which provided counsel to the Regional Government utilizing Artificial Intelligence to combat Covid-19. Our group emerged as the victor of the worldwide Xprize 'Pandemic Response Challenge,' and I have contributed multiple publications on this subject.

- Within the realm of Bayesian Spatial Statistics, my work has been featured in journals such as Mathematics, JABES, SORT, and GeoSpatial Health. I have also presented over 30 papers at conferences (out of a total of 227), including 8 invited talks.

- I have participated in more than 20 projects (continuous funding since 2006 through MTM or GV) and research contracts, often in the role of principal investigator. I am a member of the National Network BIOSTATNET, Valencia-VaBaR Node, and the AIDS Research Network, CIBER-Infecciosas.

- Regarding knowledge transfer, I played a role in the establishment of the spin-off company Compostingreen S.L. and contributed to the development of significant statistical software, including one created for Eurostat, used for predicting agricultural production in the EU. Additionally, I have worked on the 'eat:efficiency analysis trees' R-package, a valuable tool.

- I earned the Best Poster Award at the International Workshop on Statistical Modelling 2010, where I presented a poster on my thesis titled 'Geostatistical models for the study of bioclimatic indices.' I have also received 3 UMH awards for Research Production.

- My teaching experience extends from 2004, encompassing both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. Since 2018, I have held the position of Associate Professor. I have been invited to teach in more than 20 postgraduate courses and subjects, as well as engage in various teaching activities across different institutions. In 2016, I received the Teaching Talent Award, and in 2020, I received positive assessments within the DOCENTIA program.

- I have supervised 67 Master's Theses (58 Master's Degrees in Secondary Education and 9 research master's degrees), 11 Final Theses, 1 Final Thesis Erasmus+, and 5 Final Degree Projects. Additionally, I have provided guidance to over 20 internship students.

- My commitment to continual improvement in teaching is evident through the publication of 11 teaching papers, involvement in 8 innovation projects (5 as the principal investigator), and the acquisition of the title of university expert in Technological Innovation in Education. I have also participated in more than 20 training courses and conferences. Consequently, I have transitioned from being a learner to being an educator, delivering training courses within the UMH-plan for teaching innovation.

- In the realm of university management, I served as Deputy Vice Rector for Research from 2011 to the present (2011-2015, 2015-2019, 2019-). Since 2015, I have held the position of President of the Animal Welfare Body of the UMH. I also serve as Secretary of the UMH Research Commission and as a Member of the Doctoral Commission.

- From 2014 to 2019, I held the role of Treasurer for the Spanish Society of Biostatistics (Spanish region of the International Biometric Society).

- I lead the research group 'Techniques and Applications in Biostatistics,' which has received positive evaluations within the EAITTDiC of the University, following the regulations approved by the Governing Council in March 2017. I am also a member of the 'Valencia Bayesian Research Group' and the 'SEIO-Bayes group' since 2014. I serve as the head of the 'Joint Research Unit for statistical methods in health sciences UMH-FISABIO.'
