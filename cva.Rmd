## CV Summary
  
  Dr. Xavier Barber (Dénia -Spain-, 1972). PhD in statistics (2009), and as a statistician, I enjoy applying statistics to the real world. I regularly use Bayesian statistics, and I try to apply the spatio-temporal hierarchical techniques to ecology, especially in the field of Species Distribution Modelling. Currently my main theoretical and applied interest is the uncertainty quantification in this research area. In addition, as a head of joint research unit UMH-FISABIO, I'm working in advanced statistical methods applied to health science.
  
I briefly outline the most outstanding results of my academic activity in recent years:

- The publication of more than 100 papers (JCR journals, SCOPUS, dialnet, book chapters and proceedings), highlighting the development or participation in 49 articles in JCR journals. Initially linked to Public Health with a "Formación de Personal Investigador (FPI)" grant (1997-2005), with my first publications in journals such as BMC Cancer, Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, European Journal of Epidemiology, etc. Later I started teaching at the Polytechnic School of Orihuela and my research was framed in Agronomy and Food Technology (lines that I am still active today) (Food Quality, Food Chemistry, Crops and Industrial Products, Soil Science and Plant Analysis, etc.). I have two CNEAI periods (2008-2013, 2014-2019) and one AVAP (2005-2010). I can't apply for periods before 2005 because I have been working in private companies and this is incompatible with such an application, although I have articles with a high number of citations published during the period 1997-2004.


- I have belonged (2020-2022) to the "Valencia IA 4 Covid", a taskforce working group led by Dr. Nuria Oliver that advised the Regional Government using Artificial Intelligence against Covid-19. Winning group of the worldwide Xprize "Pandemic Response Challenge". I have published several articles on this topic.

- Within the field of Bayesian Spatial Statistics I have published in journals as Mathematics, JABES, SORT or  GeoSpatial Health, more than 30 communications in conferences (over a total of 227), plus 8 invited talks.

- Participation in more than 20 projects (consecutive funding since 2006 with MTM or GV) and research contracts (consultancy, in several of them as PI). I belong to the National Network BIOSTATNET, Valencia-VaBaR Node and the AIDS Research Network, CIBER-Infecciosas.

- My transfer activity: I have participated in the constitution of the spin-off Compostingreen S.L. and the development of statistical software of undeniable importance, such as the one developed for Eurostat, used in the prediction of agricultural production in the EU, moreover the "eat:efficiency  analysis trees" R-package.

- Best Poster Award at the International Workshop on Statistical Modelling 2010 (Poster on my Thesis: Geostatistical models for the study of bioclimatic indices) and 3 UMH awards for Research Production.

- Teaching since 2004 both at undergraduate and postgraduate levels, since 2018 as Associste Professor. I have also been invited to teach more than 20 postgraduate courses/subjects and other teaching activities in various institutions. Teaching Talent Award 2016 and positive assessment in 2020, within the DOCENTIA program.

- The direction of 67 Master Thesis (58  Master's Degree in Secondary Education and 9 research master's degree), 11 Final thesis, 1 Final thesis Erasmus+ and 5 Final degree project, as well as the internship tutoring more than 20 students.

- The interest in constant improvement in teaching activity, as evidenced by the publication of 11 teaching papers, participation in 8 innovation projects (in 5 as principal investigator), the title of university expert in Technological Innovation in Education, as well as participation in more than 20 training courses and conferences. As a result, I have gone from being a trainer to being a trainer, giving training courses in the teaching innovation UMH-plan.

- University Management: Deputy Vice Rector for Research (2011-2015, 2015-2019, 2019-), since 2015 as President of the Animal Welfare Body of the UMH. Secretary of the UMH Research Commission and Member of the Doctoral Commission.

- Former Treasurer of the Spanish Society of Biostatistics (Spanish region of International Biometric Society) from 2014 to 2019.

- Head of the research group  "Techniques and Applications in Biostatistics"  with positive evaluations within the EAITTDiC of the University according to the regulations approved by the Governing Council in March 2017. Member of the "Valencia Bayesian Research Group" and the "SEIO-Bayes group" since 2014 and head of the "Joint Research Unit  for statistical methods in health sciences UMH-FISABIO".
