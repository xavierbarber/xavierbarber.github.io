PhD in\n            statistics (2009), and as a statistician, I enjoy applying\n            statistics to the real world. I regularly use Bayesian\n            statistics, and I try to apply the spatio-temporal\n            hierarchical techniques to ecology, especially in the field\n            of Species Distribution Modelling. Currently my main\n            theoretical and applied interest is the uncertainty\n            quantification in this research area. In addition, as a head\n            of joint research unit UMH-FISABIO, I’m working in advanced\n            statistical methods applied to health science.\n            I briefly outline the most outstanding results of my\n            academic activity in recent years:\n            The publication of more than 100 papers (JCR\n            journals, SCOPUS, dialnet, book chapters and proceedings),\n            highlighting the development or participation in 49 articles\n            in JCR journals. Initially linked to Public Health with a\n            “Formación de Personal Investigador (FPI)” grant\n            (1997-2005), with my first publications in journals such as\n            BMC Cancer, Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health,\n            European Journal of Epidemiology, etc. Later I started\n            teaching at the Polytechnic School of Orihuela and my\n            research was framed in Agronomy and Food Technology (lines\n            that I am still active today) (Food Quality, Food Chemistry,\n            Crops and Industrial Products, Soil Science and Plant\n            Analysis, etc.). I have two CNEAI periods (2008-2013,\n            2014-2019) and one AVAP (2005-2010). I can’t apply for\n            periods before 2005 because I have been working in private\n            companies and this is incompatible with such an application,\n            although I have articles with a high number of citations\n            published during the period 1997-2004.\n            I have belonged (2020-2022) to the “Valencia IA 4\n            Covid”, a taskforce working group led by Dr. Nuria Oliver\n            that advised the Regional Government using Artificial\n            Intelligence against Covid-19. Winning group of the\n            worldwide Xprize “Pandemic Response Challenge”. I have\n            published several articles on this topic.\n            Within the field of Bayesian Spatial Statistics I\n            have published in journals as Mathematics, JABES, SORT or\n            GeoSpatial Health, more than 30 communications in\n            conferences (over a total of 227), plus 8 invited\n            talks.\n            Participation in more than 20 projects (consecutive\n            funding since 2006 with MTM or GV) and research contracts\n            (consultancy, in several of them as PI). I belong to the\n            National Network BIOSTATNET, Valencia-VaBaR Node and the\n            AIDS Research Network, CIBER-Infecciosas.\n            My transfer activity: I have participated in the\n            constitution of the spin-off Compostingreen S.L. and the\n            development of statistical software of undeniable\n            importance, such as the one developed for Eurostat, used in\n            the prediction of agricultural production in the EU,\n            moreover the “eat:efficiency analysis trees”\n            R-package.\n            Best Poster Award at the International Workshop on\n            Statistical Modelling 2010 (Poster on my Thesis:\n            Geostatistical models for the study of bioclimatic indices)\n            and 3 UMH awards for Research Production.\n            Teaching since 2004 both at undergraduate and\n            postgraduate levels, since 2018 as Associste Professor. I\n            have also been invited to teach more than 20 postgraduate\n            courses/subjects and other teaching activities in various\n            institutions.

1972). PhD in\n              statistics (2009), and as a statistician, I enjoy applying\n              statistics to the real world. I regularly use Bayesian\n              statistics, and I try to apply the spatio-temporal\n              hierarchical techniques to ecology, especially in the\n              field of Species Distribution Modelling. Currently my main\n              theoretical and applied interest is the uncertainty\n              quantification in this research area. In addition, as a\n              head of joint research unit UMH-FISABIO, I’m working in\n              advanced statistical methods applied to health\n              science.\n              I briefly outline the most outstanding results of my\n              academic activity in recent years:\n              The publication of more than 100 papers (JCR\n              journals, SCOPUS, dialnet, book chapters and proceedings),\n              highlighting the development or participation in 49\n              articles in JCR journals. Initially linked to Public\n              Health with a “Formación de Personal Investigador (FPI)”\n              grant (1997-2005), with my first publications in journals\n              such as BMC Cancer, Journal of Epidemiology and Community\n              Health, European Journal of Epidemiology, etc. Later I\n              started teaching at the Polytechnic School of Orihuela and\n              my research was framed in Agronomy and Food Technology\n              (lines that I am still active today) (Food Quality, Food\n              Chemistry, Crops and Industrial Products, Soil Science and\n              Plant Analysis, etc.). I have two CNEAI periods\n              (2008-2013, 2014-2019) and one AVAP (2005-2010). I can’t\n              apply for periods before 2005 because I have been working\n              in private companies and this is incompatible with such an\n              application, although I have articles with a high number\n              of citations published during the period\n              1997-2004.\n              I have belonged (2020-2022) to the “Valencia IA 4\n              Covid”, a taskforce working group led by Dr. Nuria Oliver\n              that advised the Regional Government using Artificial\n              Intelligence against Covid-19. Winning group of the\n              worldwide Xprize “Pandemic Response Challenge”. I have\n              published several articles on this topic.\n              Within the field of Bayesian Spatial Statistics I\n              have published in journals as Mathematics, JABES, SORT or\n              GeoSpatial Health, more than 30 communications in\n              conferences (over a total of 227), plus 8 invited\n              talks.\n              Participation in more than 20 projects (consecutive\n              funding since 2006 with MTM or GV) and research contracts\n              (consultancy, in several of them as PI).
