I was born in Dénia (Spain) in 1972 and graduated in Statistics (2000). I got my PhD in Statistics in 2009. The thesis title was "Geostastistical models for bioclimatic indices" and my advisors were Javier Morales(Miguel Hernandez University) and Antonio López-Quílez (Valencia University).

I have been teaching and doing research in the Miguel Hernández University  since 2003 I became Associate Professor of Statistics and Operations Research in 2018.

I like to enjoy riding my bike whenever I can, whether in the mountains or on the road... whatever it is, but always to the rhythm of  Motorhead-style R'n'R.
